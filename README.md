# How To: Prismic with Schema.org

Providing search engines metadata about your websiteâ€™s content allows for rich search results sourced from your website. Rich results are typically prioritized over webpage results and often allow searchers to act directly on them, such as saving an event or viewing a map.

[Schema.org][schema-org] defines standardized sets of attributes for almost any kind of metadata you want to share with search engines.

This example project demonstrates a few kinds of schemas to show how you can connect your websiteâ€™s content to whichever schema you need.

[**See the full guide on Prismic's documentation website.**](https://prismic.io/docs/schema-org-nextjs)

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```
npx degit prismicio-community/how-to-nextjs-schema-org how-to-nextjs-schema-org
cd how-to-nextjs-schema-org
npx @slicemachine/init
```

The commands will do the following:

1. Start a new Next.js project using this example.
2. Ask you to log in to Prismic or [create an account][prismic-sign-up].
3. Create a new Prismic content repository with sample content.

When you're ready to start your project, run the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```
